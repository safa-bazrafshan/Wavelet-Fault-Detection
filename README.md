# Wavelet-Based Fault Detection in Simulated Signals

This project demonstrates how discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be used to distinguish between a healthy and a faulty signal. It uses MATLAB to simulate two signals and perform a 4-level wavelet decomposition, followed by energy analysis to detect anomalies.

## Project Overview

- Language: MATLAB  
- Main Focus: Signal processing, Fault detection, Wavelet transform  
- Toolboxes: Signal Processing Toolbox, Wavelet Toolbox  

## Features

- Generation of synthetic healthy and faulty signals
- Wavelet decomposition using db4 over four levels
- Visualization of wavelet details (D1–D4) for both signals
- Energy comparison across levels
- PDF report with plots and analysis

## Files

- wavelet_fault_detection.m: Main MATLAB script  
- Wavelet_Fault_Analysis_Report.pdf: Project summary with figures  
- (Optional) PNG files for individual figures (if available)

## Sample Output

- 2 Time-domain signals (clean and noisy)
- 8 Wavelet detail plots (D1–D4)
- Bar chart comparing energy distribution across wavelet levels
